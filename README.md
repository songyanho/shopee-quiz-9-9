Scenario: A Shopee employee receives an urgent delivery order. The journey towards the destination is a tricky one filled with obstacles, which he must avoid. The employee can only take 7 steps forward (non-diagonal) before his vehicle runs out of petrol. To replenish his petrol (to get the full 7 steps), he has to stop by the nearest petrol kiosk. 

Based on the map below, and given that stepping on the petrol kiosk box for refueling counts as 1 step,
i) How many steps will the shortest path be?
ii) Using your answer to i), how many of such paths can the employee possibly take to get from Start to End?
(e.g. if your answer to i) is 100, how many 100-step paths can the employee take from Start to End?)
